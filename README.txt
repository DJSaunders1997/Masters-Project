This submission contains:
	- This README.txt.
	- The dissertation pdf document.
	- 5 Jupyter Notebooks where the main work of the project is completed.
	- A JSONtoCV.py file which was created to transform the data from its original JSON format to a CSV format.

To download the previous study's mouse Mouse go to 
https://github.com/gabysbrain/datasets and follow the instructions.
The data is found in the '/datasets-sa_mouse_tracking/' folder.

In order to run all the code the Notebooks must be executed in order from 1 to 5.
This is because some of the notebooks rely on transformations made to the original data in other Notebooks.
