\section{Literature review}

In this section I will review the literature on how to monitor attention.

%This can pretty much be the review I did for the first assignment. 

\section{Background Research}
Anything I've looked at with help for mouse data classification algorithms? 


\section{Motivation and Aims of project}
Can copy from presentation slides but fill in so they're more wordy.

\subsection{Motivation}

People are lazy. 
Often don't pay much attention 
Is there any way of measuring people's attention?

Why mouse data?
Mouse cursor position is strongly correlated with eye position. 
One paper calls it a “poor man's eye-tracker” [find]
Bulky expensive equipment for eye tracking is expensive and very obtrusive.
Hawthorn / observer effect - People react differently when being observed. 
Less obtrusive mouse tracking can make people feel less tracked and act more naturally. 
Could even not tell them (legal ethical repercussions)!

\subsection{Aims of project}

The aims of what I want to achieve in the project will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualise, analyse and understand the data results.
    \item Use the data to train machine learning models to classify users between 2 groups.
    \item Combine the data and methods from the study data with other datasets to create a more robust model.
    \item Stretch goal? Test methods and models developed with other applications?
\end{itemize}

Talk here about how I will achieve each aim, then describe the components of the project that I will need to complete.
Try and link each component of the project to an aim.

Machine learning methods
    SVM
    Natural Language Processing
    N-Grams
    LSTM Neural Networks
    Markov models
Deal with Imbalances in classes
    Sampling
    Oversampling, Undersampling
Other mouse data sources

Applications
A good system developed could be used for other tasks to monitor attention - E.g. Survey Monika made us do. Not just for joes ice-cream
Have to decide on the trade off between a good narrow (is this the right word) classifier between attention or not and a more generalised model that can work on any task.
What I mean by that is I can model the html elements / sliders to see how users interacted to see the stock prices, or I can generalise to any such task involving mouse data.

\section{Project plan}

\subsection{Development methodology}
Discuss software life cycle methodologies with Jacques.
An agile methodology such as scrum would probably be best but am I constrained  by this specification document?

\section{Risk Analysis}
% Copy risk analysis from last year.
When creating a project there is always potential risks that the project might encounter and hinder its chances of success. 
In order to prepare and to hopefully avoid these risks I will now list and analyse the most likely, and most devastating risks to my project. 
By analysing each risk individually I will be prepared in case I come across any of the potential risks and I will have developed a plan of action of what to do and how to manage myself in case of encountering them. 
I will initially list the risks in a table where I will briefly examine them, then I will go into each one in more detail. 
Below I have listed and analysed the risks and have ordered them from potentially the most dangerous to least dangerous.

\section{Conclusion}

Measuring user engagement is challenging
Mouse data can help us solve that issue by showing user attention
Data Science techniques could be used to help classify the data (Not SVM)
