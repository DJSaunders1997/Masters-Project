\section{Introduction}
Can copy from presentation slides but fill in so they're more wordy.

\subsection{Motivation}

People are lazy. 
Often don't pay much attention 
Is there any way of measuring people's attention?

Why mouse data?
Mouse cursor position is strongly correlated with eye position. 
One paper calls it a “poor man's eye-tracker” [find]
Bulky expensive equipment for eye tracking is expensive and very obtrusive.
Hawthorn / observer effect - People react differently when being observed. 
Less obtrusive mouse tracking can make people feel less tracked and act more naturally. 
Could even not tell them (legal ethical repercussions)!

\subsection{Aims of project}

The aims of what I want to achieve in the project will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualise, analyse and understand the data results.
    \item Use the data to train machine learning models to classify users between 2 groups.
    \item Combine the data and methods from the study data with other datasets to create a more robust model.
    \item Stretch goal? Test methods and models developed with other applications?
\end{itemize}

Talk here about how I will achieve each aim, then describe the components of the project that I will need to complete.
Try and link each component of the project to an aim.

Machine learning methods
    SVM
    Natural Language Processing
    N-Grams
    LSTM Neural Networks
    Markov models
Deal with Imbalances in classes
    Sampling
    Oversampling, Undersampling
Other mouse data sources

Applications
A good system developed could be used for other tasks to monitor attention - E.g. Survey Monika made us do. Not just for joes ice-cream
Have to decide on the trade off between a good narrow (is this the right word) classifier between attention or not and a more generalised model that can work on any task.
What I mean by that is I can model the html elements / sliders to see how users interacted to see the stock prices, or I can generalise to any such task involving mouse data.


\section{Background Research}
Anything I've looked at with help for mouse data classification algorithms? 

%\section{Literature review}
In this section I will review the literature on how to monitor attention.
%This can pretty much be the review I did for the first assignment. 

\section{Description of the project}

\subsection{Components of project}
Each of the following are separate sections that can be completed separately, but linearly.

Repeat this process N times
(
Research of different algorithms and methods.
Coding section.
The visualisations of results.
Write up of results.
)

Compile results together into dissertation.

TODO: Look at the dissertation outline so I know what stuff needs to be included so I can mention it here.

\section{Project plan}
% Look into different software methodologies
% http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csetzer/articles/researchMethodologiesInComputerScience.pdf
% 

The different components of the work have been explained above.
This section will specify the timeframe and order in which the modules will be carried out.

Thinking of an agile methodology as it will allow flexibility of my project and the iterative nature should help me to constantly improve it \cite{beck2001manifesto}. 

Scrum will be used as the short scrum periods will encourage bursts of development over the long summer period.

\subsection{Development methodology}
Discuss software life cycle methodologies with Jacques.
An agile methodology such as scrum would probably be best but am I constrained  by this specification document?

We want a methodology that has a final write up, but also has lots of iterative stuff in the middle for me to research, explore, and test new algorithms.
For that reason I will be following the Scrum software lifecycle methodology.


Figure \ref{fig:Gantt} shows the sprints I will be undertaking.
Each sprint starts with a supervisor meeting where the previous work, and the plan for the next sprint will be discussed.
There will be three sprints in total, with each sprint being a fortnight long.
Each sprint will consist of researching a method I may be able to use in my project.
Then I will spend time modifying and implementing the method so that it may be used in the context of this project.
The latter half of a sprint will consist of analysing and visualising the results of the method and writing these down roughly in the dissertation document.
For example I may find a particular varient of ANN, have to mo

\end{figure}


\subsection{Risk Analysis}
% Copy risk analysis from last year.
When creating a project there is always potential risks that the project might encounter and hinder its chances of success. 
In order to prepare and to hopefully avoid these risks I will now list and analyse the risks of my project. 
By analysing each risk individually I will be prepared in case I come across any of the potential risks and I will have developed a plan of action of what to do and how to manage myself in case of encountering them. 
Each risk is explained with the likelihood of the risk occurring and impact to the project the risk would have.
A mitigation plan is created in an attempt to prevent the risk from happening, and a contingency plan is made so I can be prepared if the risk does occur.
Below I have listed and analysed the risks and have ordered them from potentially the most dangerous to least dangerous. 




% Please add the following required packages to your document preamble:
% \usepackage[table,xcdraw]{xcolor}
% If you use beamer only pass "xcolor=table" option, i.e. \documentclass[xcolor=table]{beamer}

%REPLACE this table with an itemized list, like in the data visualisation module.
% - Tom said that tables can make it too restrictive.
% Just coppied from table here, make sure to flesh out later
% TODO: Flesh out risks 

% Do I keep explaination or just expand risks in the risk item?

\begin{description}
    \item[Risk:]    
    \underline{Unrealistic time plan and poor time management.}
    \item[Likelihood and Impact:]
    Medium likelihood, Medium Impact
    \item[Explaination]
    If my time is spent poorly then I could not have a piece of work finished for the submission deadline, or the work may not represent the best of my abilities.  
    \item[Mitigation:]
    Create work schedule and stick to it.
    A work schedule and plan for the summer has been created in this document which I aim to follow.
    \item[Contingency:]
    If I am unable to stick to my work schedule, I must adapt my approach to work and create an undated, more realistic schedule.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
    \item[Risk:]
    \underline{Coronavirus affects me or a close family member, negatively effecting my work.}
    \item[Likelihood and Impact:]
    Medium likelihood, High Risk
    \item[Explaination]
    Coronavirus is very contagious. 
    Dispute risks it is still likely that the I may become infected. 
    \item[Mitigation:]
    Stay safe indoors during the quarantine to keep everyone safe and mitigate any risks of me catching anything.
    \item[Contingency:]
    Inform the University as soon as a situation develops so that alternative assessments can be organised.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
    \item[Risk:]    
    \underline{No correlation between attention and mouse tracking data can be found.}    
    \item[Likelihood and Impact:]
    Medium likelihood, High impact
    \item[Explaination:]
    The project will involve the use of many methods to find a link between mouse tracking data and user attention.
    It is possible that after all methods have been exhausted no correlation is ever discovered, or simply doesn't exist. 
    \item[Mitigation:]
    Attempt as many different methods of classification early before writing in depth about them.  
    \item[Contingency:]
    If no insights can be gained from the given dataset, I will explore other similar datasets and attempt to find correlations there.
    I will then attempt to apply findings from other datasets to the original dataset. 
\end{description}

\begin{description}
    \item[Risk:]    
    Coronavirus has a greater impact on Swansea University and  effects the available support and deadlines.
    \item[Likelihood and Impact:]
    Low likelihood, Low impact
    \item[Explaination:]
    The virus has already shut down in person teaching and with the UK in lockdown it is unlikely the situation will become vastly different. 
    \item[Mitigation:]
    Keep informed with the University College of Science and supervisor to any news effecting the University.
    \item[Contingency:]
    TODO: What is the plan? Keep my options open? Keep updated?
    Keep updated with the situation and follow whatever advice is recommended from the university.

\section{Conclusion}

Measuring user engagement is challenging
Mouse data can help us solve that issue by showing user attention
Data Science techniques could be used to help classify the data (Not SVM)

% Project meeting
% ############## Programming Questions ############
% Points start and end at different points, for both lab and actual, is that expected? 
%     How was it measured? Moving window?
%     How do I reference this in diss?
%     Can I just transform points to new position? But how do I do other points not just start end.

% In Data online turk has alloc-slider-5 while lab study has stuff like [id="alloc-slider-return-4"]>svg>g>circle and [id="alloc-slider-return-4"]>svg. can just remove the brackets but whats the >svg>g>circle?

% Lab has no buttons,  and some that say just html?

% Presentation Questions
% #############################################

% Marks for Presentation 65 I was happy with. Feel like 65 is good a merit but lower than other marks so should I be disappointed?

% For motivation and background of project do I just say what I did in my presentation?
% onje sentence explaion what i do why and helpful. By end of first paragraph! so people dont get lost.
% Said how I will evaluate.-  we will evalutate teh algorithm by comparing again stest dataset.

% http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gleicher/Web/Advice/PaperRecipe

% ##################### Project Specification #################

% No existing work section on project specificaton, so I dont say anything? Not that ive done much but transform Data and do SVM.

% Literature review for project, is this not just what I did for the initial thing? cant remember what it was called but whatever.
% - Why cant trhie approach be used for mine
% Do want to add a section maybe on NLP and semi-supervised learning. But hows NLP a literature review of project, even assuming it works at all??

% In risk assessment of project, ive said covid effecting uni, and covid effecting me. 2 more risks of me failing at time management and me failing to find any correlation between mouse and attention in the data. Is this ok?

% How would I mitigate these risks?
% I think no correlation is kinda likely, while youd intuitevly think that there may be a correlation no other studies seem to back it up and with so little data points its hard to draw any actual conclusions.
