Finish Semi-Supervised Learning section with references.

Properly reference and talk about previous study mine is based off.

Contributions, try and rephrase what's mentioned everywhere else.

Change Hidden Markov Model section from notes to actual written stuff.

Fully update results to reclassifying if they're above line y=x, not regression.

Talk about how we had to rename the mouse targets with stuff like anything containing the words alloc-slider-1 was renamed.
Issue with Lab and Turk data having a different naming scheme.
Maybe have a table showing the elements name before and after renaming.

Maybe double check with other HMM using mouse location data.
Stretch goal as I don't think this adds much other than saying I can make another HMM but with completely different results.
