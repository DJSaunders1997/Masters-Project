Thanks for meeting, I have a few points and not much time unfortunately.

1.
Started work as a Data Engineer with LV insurance.
Good so far, enjoying it.

2.
I've been referencing your paper risk fixers and sweet spotters, but is that the correct paper?
Kinda based on that but also more Grubers thesis.
I have a draft version and nothing finished, is there a finished one and how can I cite?

3.
Main question I have is when can I get you to look over it.
I can have a very rough draft on the weekend or Monday for you to skim over
    , then based on that brief feedback get an actual first draft the week after?
I appreciate you'll be very busy so I want to find a solution that works for you.

4.
"Record of supervision form"?
Didn't realise this was a thing.
Obviously we've met fairly regularly but how should I fill this in.

5. 
Word Limit of 20,000
I have 5,000 at the moment.
Will definitely go up but no way more than 10,000.
This okay?

6.
Extensions available for students with 
"Extensions may be granted occasionally in extenuating circumstances 
(extreme personal/medical problems, 
or excessive work commitments), 
but these will have to be well documented and any application for extension should be made well before the final submission deadline."

Should be okay, is it worth nothing this potential issue now?
If I get beneath 50% anyway I can also resubmit later.
