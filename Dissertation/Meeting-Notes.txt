Would really appreciate a skim through of my diss for some guidance, so if Im going down the wrong path already that can be fixed asap.

Wanted to wait and have a more finished product for you to look at, but also don't want it too late either.
There's still a question of will it be too short?
With more padding out in all the sections and a more extensive related work I think it should be enough?
8,000 words now, possibly up to 12,000 after everything but thats still under the limit.
Not sure what else could be added.


Will look through my diss bringing up some questions I have for you if thats ok.
Hopfully makes life a bit easier for you to give you an idea of what im thinking.

What to put in contributions, obviously what this diss contributes but isnt this said in the abstract?
Maybe just more in depth here, but not sure how indepth I can be.

Should Hidden Markov Model be in related work?
Probably not as its just a model and I'm looking into specific bits of literature.

Not sure what to put in methodology, I think I talk about the methodology in the data pipeline section.

Repeated experiments, this section was added even though it doesnt really relate to the final outcome of the diss.
Just to show that I have done work.
It does feel a bit tacked on though.

Results okay I think, just need to be padded out a bit.
Maybe too many graphs, but think I need them to convey the information.

Further results section I wasn't going to have originally either.
This was a secondary attempt at a HMM but on different data.
I suppose the results are interesting, but theres no reason why this should be a secondary model and not my main one.
Should I change the abstract and intro to say multiple HMMs were created on different parts of the data?

Conclusion and Future work are to be padded out also.
