Report was bad

What is x, y ? - Pixels, are there different screen resolutions?

What does the task look like? - Good for motovation and background in presentation

Can only get lab study data - combine_study_data.sh removes all files


apply model to other turk studies and find whos paying attention.

tree, svm, random forrest


LSTM NN - good for time
try trigram, tuple of 3 items actions
3 actions at a time
start with 3 mouse actions at a time.

Hyptothesis if lots of drag and ditrvtion change = more interation = more attention 

(Try model time)
